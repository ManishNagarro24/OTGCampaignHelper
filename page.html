      <td>\n\nI am fundraising to build a Mosque in the Philippines. This project is organized by Ummah Welfare Trust. We need 17 people to donate �5 each to reach the target of �12,000. This mosque will be a place of worship and will also provide Islamic education and community services. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said that whoever builds a mosque for the pleasure of Allah, Allah will build a house in Paradise for him. This project will cost �84 per person and will provide prayer space and facilities for 144 worshippers. Your donation will be a great act of charity and will bring many benefits to the people in the Philippines. May Allah reward you generously and grant you a house in Paradise, ameen.</td>

      <td>\n\nYour donation can make a big difference in helping to fund high quality biomedical research into Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME), a neurological disease that can affect people of all ages. So far, we have raised over �650,000 for Invest in ME charity, which is based at the world-renowned Norwich Research Park and works with leading researchers in the UK and abroad. Our goal is to reach �1 million to fund the next phases of the research strategy, including a clinical trial of rituximab in ME. ME can cause severe symptoms, such as muscle pain and weakness, and can cause post-exertional neuro-immune exhaustion (PENE) or post-exertional malaise (PEM). There is still no universal thumbprint diagnostic test or cure, and few treatments are available to ease the symptoms. Donating through JustGiving is easy, fast and safe. To donate �1 to support this cause, text APFR99 to 70070 (UK) or donate from �2 via this page. For more information about ME and Invest in ME charity's work, please visit www.investinme.org or www.ldifme.org. Together, we can make a difference and help change the lives of those affected by ME. Thank you for your support!</td>
