On 1st & 2nd April 2023 Harvey will undertake his next mammoth challenge, walking 40 miles from Alder Hey Children's Hospital to Old Trafford Football Stadium. Once again Manchester United Legend Sammy McIlroy as well as his head teacher, school teachers and fabulous friends and family will be joining him along the way.

Following on from last years 16 mile walk from Stockton Heath Primary School to Old Trafford to raise much needed funds to improve his school playground, Harvey is planning another challenge. This year Harvey is upping the ante and plans to undertake a 40 mile walk over two days from Alder Hey Children's Hospital to Old Trafford Football Stadium.


7 year old Harvey came up with the idea to walk from Alder Hey to Old Trafford as his 7 year old cousin, Zak is currently undergoing gruelling chemotherapy treatment for an aggressive form of cancer. Any money raised will go to Alder Hey Children's hospital for the incredible work that they do and towards supporting the family through this difficult time.

Alder Hey Children's Hospital raises vital funds to help make it a truly world-class patient-friendly hospital for 330,000 patients and families they care for every year.
